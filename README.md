## Integrating Smart Traffic Management and Electric Energy Generation at Intersections
* The duration of the green light in our  smart traffic system is adjusted based on the number of cars, which regulates traffic conditions at any intersection.
* Pedestrian push button option in this smart traffic system is applied, which prioritizes pedestrians.
* Electricity is generated from moving cars on the road in order to employ renewable energy for the transportation industry.
### Equipment List
* UNO R3 Starter Kit.
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Module.
